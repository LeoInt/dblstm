cpu - cpu implementation cblas based.
standard - kaldi like implementation (some lines commented in code to be more kaldi like but not correct).
fusepw - standard with fused operations after gemv.
streambwfw - fusepw with 2 streams for each layer, fw and bw.
streamLayer - uses multithread for having multiple streams.
halffloat - uses half float data for weights and same as fusepw for computation.
lowmem - does not use tmp_i buffer but just one array. is it interesting ??????
fuse_gemvpw - fuses gemv with pw operations.
fusexhmatr - fuses x and h matrix in one gemv (no more gemm).
